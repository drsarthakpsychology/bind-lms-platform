## RESEARCH ROUND — free LLM tier follow-ups (2026-08-14)

- [x] **Wire Groq as Primary Director/Actor provider**: registry now routes
  `json`/`chat`/`stream` to groq first (no-train → serves student data);
  engine uses capability "json" (Director) + stream (Actor) with workload
  `sim_patient_turn`; json_object + Zod-repair + failover path; 4 router tests.
  Only blocker: `GROQ_API_KEY` (in NEEDS_KAVYA). json_schema left as json_object
  — Groq's strict mode is "in flux" and Cerebras 422s without additionalProperties:false
  on all objects; the provider-agnostic Zod-repair path is the reliable choice. [research 2026-08-14]
- [x] **Wire Cerebras as Fallback Director/Actor provider**: already the
  no-train JSON fallback in the registry (second after groq). Needs
  `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` (in NEEDS_KAVYA). [research 2026-08-14]
- [x] **OpenRouter free-tier decision surfaced**: stays an overflow lane at 50
  RPD; the one-time $10 → 1,000 RPD choice is Kavya's call — surfaced in
  NEEDS_KAVYA. [research 2026-08-14]
- [x] **Quota re-verify at integration time**: surfaced in NEEDS_KAVYA as a
  go-live reminder — limits are account-dependent and moved through 2026. [research 2026-08-14]

## BEASTMODE ROUND 9 — attempt tables + content wiring + polish (2026-08-13)

- [x] **Attempt Tables (MSE)**: Wire `mse_attempts` write on MSE level completion (level-observe → level-domain → level-full-mse → level-live-mse) — follows `osce_attempts` pattern [IDEAS_NEXT #1]
- [x] **Attempt Tables (Formulation)**: Wire `formulation_attempts` write on Formulation Forge completion (5P grid + narrative + diff) [IDEAS_NEXT #1]
- [x] **Attempt Tables (SCT)**: Wire `sct_attempts` write on SCT Arena completion (panel scored) [IDEAS_NEXT #1]
- [x] **Content Wiring (MSE)**: Replace static TS stimuli in `level-observe/level-domain/level-full-mse/level-live-mse` with readers from live `mse_stimuli` table (seeded) [IDEAS_NEXT #2]
- [x] **Content Wiring (Formulation)**: Replace static TS cases in Formulation Forge with readers from live `formulation_cases` table (seeded) [IDEAS_NEXT #2]
- [x] **Content Wiring (Idioms)**: decode drill merges approved `public.idioms` with the static bank (new approvals appear, content never reduced); Rounds/Clinic use idioms via their own content structures [IDEAS_NEXT #2]
- [x] **ElevenLabs TTS**: Wire Kavya's ElevenLabs account (voice "Rudra") into the TTS provider chain as premium tier above Qwen3 [IDEAS_NEXT #3]
- [x] **Recurring Patient Arcs (scaffold)**: chain created on debrief, /today surfaces it; follow_up content still needs a spec [IDEAS_NEXT #4]
- [x] **Polish (OSCE Debrief)**: Ensure debrief shows checklist fraction, global rating, and composite with same visual language as Consulting Room debrief [polish]
- [x] **Tests**: Add 5 integration tests covering attempt-table writes for MSE/Formulation/SCT (fixture-tested, deterministic) [Master §11]

## BEASTMODE ROUND 9 cont. — briefs-verified gaps (2026-08-13)

- [x] **Content Wiring (Idioms)**: decode drill merges approved `public.idioms` with the static bank (new approvals appear, content never reduced); Rounds/Clinic use idioms via their own content structures [IDEAS_NEXT #2]
- [x] **Content Wiring (MSE)**: Replace static TS stimuli in level-observe/domain/full-mse/live-mse with readers from live `mse_stimuli` (now 30 seeded) [IDEAS_NEXT #2]
- [x] **Content Wiring (Formulation)**: Replace static SEED_FORMULATION in forge with readers from live `formulation_cases` [IDEAS_NEXT #2]
- [x] **Rounds per-user scheduling**: Persist reviews to `card_reviews` (deck reseeds state per visit today); due queue + history. Seeds have no DB id — scope to published cards [verified gap]
- [x] **Quiz after lesson completion**: QuizCheck is wired in decode/ethics/mse/osce but lessons have no quiz surface [briefs scan]
- [x] **OSCE voice mode**: voice delivery only in Consulting Room today; OSCE is "voice strongly preferred" but text-only [briefs scan]
- [x] **Cohort pulse nudge**: /admin/pulse nudge records intent but doesn't call the real nudge API [briefs scan]
- [x] **ElevenLabs TTS**: premium tier voice "Rudra" — needs Kavya's account keys [IDEAS_NEXT #3]
- [x] **Recurring Patient Arcs (scaffold)**: chain created on debrief, /today surfaces it; follow_up content still needs a spec [IDEAS_NEXT #4]
