## BEASTMODE ROUND 9 — attempt tables + content wiring + polish (2026-08-13)

- [x] **Attempt Tables (MSE)**: Wire `mse_attempts` write on MSE level completion (level-observe → level-domain → level-full-mse → level-live-mse) — follows `osce_attempts` pattern [IDEAS_NEXT #1]
- [x] **Attempt Tables (Formulation)**: Wire `formulation_attempts` write on Formulation Forge completion (5P grid + narrative + diff) [IDEAS_NEXT #1]
- [x] **Attempt Tables (SCT)**: Wire `sct_attempts` write on SCT Arena completion (panel scored) [IDEAS_NEXT #1]
- [ ] **Content Wiring (MSE)**: Replace static TS stimuli in `level-observe/level-domain/level-full-mse/level-live-mse` with readers from live `mse_stimuli` table (seeded) [IDEAS_NEXT #2]
- [ ] **Content Wiring (Formulation)**: Replace static TS cases in Formulation Forge with readers from live `formulation_cases` table (seeded) [IDEAS_NEXT #2]
- [ ] **Content Wiring (Idioms)**: Replace static SEED_IDIOMS in Rounds/Clinic/MSE with readers from live `public.idioms` table (already 65 seeded) [IDEAS_NEXT #2]
- [ ] **ElevenLabs TTS**: Wire Kavya's ElevenLabs account (voice "Rudra") into the TTS provider chain as premium tier above Qwen3 [IDEAS_NEXT #3]
- [ ] **Recurring Patient Arcs**: Spec + scaffold `practice_chains` + `sim_cases.follow_up` content + consumer (multi-session arc UI) [IDEAS_NEXT #4]
- [x] **Polish (OSCE Debrief)**: Ensure debrief shows checklist fraction, global rating, and composite with same visual language as Consulting Room debrief [polish]
- [x] **Tests**: Add 5 integration tests covering attempt-table writes for MSE/Formulation/SCT (fixture-tested, deterministic) [Master §11]
